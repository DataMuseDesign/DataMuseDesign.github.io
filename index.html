		<p class="paragraphs">The American public school system has been increasingly focused on attempting to
			encourage all students to succeed academically. This goal is demonstrated by famous policies like
			"No Child Left Behind", the proliferation of charter schools, and the amount of energy dedicated to
			standardized testing. But have these attempts to level the playing field really worked to lift all
			students and school districts to a satisfactory level of performance?<br><br>
		We looked at data from the <a href="http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report">MA
			department of Education</a>, profiling over 400 districts across the state and reporting on the resources
			allocated, student characteristics, and student performance.

		<h4>At least in Massachusetts, historic initiatives have not allowed all students to flourish academically. Something needs to be done, but simply throwing more money at existing programs is unlikely to help – it's time to be more creative.
		<br><br>And one thing is clear – the solution needs to address districts with the worst teacher retention and understand what type of support economically disadvantaged students are lacking.</h4>
